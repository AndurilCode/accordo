# Usage Example: Development Workflow MCP Server

This example demonstrates how a coding agent (like Cursor) would use the Development Workflow MCP server to implement a new feature following the structured workflow.

## Scenario: Adding User Authentication to an API

### Step 1: Initialize Workflow

**Agent calls:** `init_workflow_guidance`
**Parameters:** `task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"`

**Guidance Response:**
```
üöÄ INITIALIZING DEVELOPMENT WORKFLOW

Task: Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API

ACTIONS TO TAKE:
1. Create or update workflow_state.md with:
   - Phase: INIT
   - Status: READY
   - CurrentItem: "Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"

2. Ensure project_config.md exists and is readable

3. Add task to the Items table in workflow_state.md:
   | 1 | Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API | pending |

‚úÖ WHEN COMPLETE:
Call prompt: 'analyze_phase_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"
```

### Step 2: Analysis Phase

**Agent calls:** `analyze_phase_guidance`
**Parameters:** `task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"`

**Guidance Response:**
```
üìä ANALYZE PHASE - NO CODING OR PLANNING YET

Current task: Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Update workflow_state.md: Phase=ANALYZE, Status=RUNNING

2. Read and understand project_config.md:
   - Note project structure
   - Identify test commands
   - Understand dependencies

3. Read relevant existing code and documentation

4. Write a clear requirements summary in ## Log section

5. Update workflow_state.md: Status=READY

‚ö†Ô∏è  IMPORTANT: NO code writing or planning in this phase!

‚úÖ WHEN COMPLETE:
Call prompt: 'blueprint_phase_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API", requirements_summary="<your analysis summary>"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- Updates workflow_state.md: Phase=ANALYZE, Status=RUNNING
- Reads project_config.md and existing codebase
- Analyzes current API structure, identifies auth endpoints needed
- Logs analysis: "API currently has no authentication. Need to add JWT middleware, login/register endpoints, user model, password hashing, token validation."
- Updates workflow_state.md: Status=READY

### Step 3: Blueprint Phase

**Agent calls:** `blueprint_phase_guidance`
**Parameters:** 
- `task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"`
- `requirements_summary="API currently has no authentication. Need JWT middleware, login/register endpoints, user model, password hashing, token validation."`

**Guidance Response:**
```
üìã BLUEPRINT PHASE - PLANNING TIME

Task: Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API
Analysis: API currently has no authentication. Need JWT middleware, login/register endpoints, user model, password hashing, token validation.

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Update workflow_state.md: Phase=BLUEPRINT, Status=RUNNING

2. Decompose the task into ordered, atomic steps

3. Write detailed plan in ## Plan section including:
   - File-by-file changes needed
   - Order of implementation
   - Test strategies
   - Risk mitigation

4. Update workflow_state.md: Status=NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL

5. Wait for user confirmation of the plan

‚úÖ WHEN USER APPROVES PLAN:
Call prompt: 'construct_phase_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"

‚ùå IF USER REJECTS PLAN:
Call prompt: 'revise_blueprint_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API", feedback="<user feedback>"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- Updates workflow_state.md: Phase=BLUEPRINT, Status=RUNNING
- Creates detailed implementation plan in ## Plan section:
  ```
  ## Plan
  1. Create User model (models/user.py)
  2. Add password hashing utilities (utils/auth.py)
  3. Create JWT token management (utils/jwt.py)
  4. Add authentication middleware (middleware/auth.py)
  5. Create auth endpoints (routes/auth.py)
  6. Add protected route decorator
  7. Update main app to include auth routes
  8. Add authentication tests
  9. Update API documentation
  ```
- Updates workflow_state.md: Status=NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL
- Waits for user approval

### Step 4: User Approval

**User:** "Plan looks good, proceed with implementation"

### Step 5: Construction Phase

**Agent calls:** `construct_phase_guidance`
**Parameters:** `task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"`

**Guidance Response:**
```
üî® CONSTRUCT PHASE - IMPLEMENTATION

Task: Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API

REQUIRED ACTIONS:
1. Update workflow_state.md: Phase=CONSTRUCT, Status=RUNNING

2. Follow the approved ## Plan exactly, step by step

3. After EACH atomic change:
   a. Run test/linter commands from project_config.md
   b. Capture output in ## Log section
   c. Fix any issues before proceeding

4. Log each step completion in ## Log

5. When all plan steps complete: Update Status=READY

‚ö†Ô∏è  CRITICAL: Follow the plan exactly - no deviations!

‚úÖ WHEN ALL STEPS COMPLETE:
Call prompt: 'validate_phase_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API"

üö® IF TESTS FAIL OR ERRORS OCCUR:
Call prompt: 'error_recovery_guidance'
Parameters: task_description="Add JWT-based user authentication to the REST API", error_details="<error description>"
```

**Agent Actions:**
- Updates workflow_state.md: Phase=CONSTRUCT, Status=RUNNING
- Implements each step from the plan:
  1. Creates User model ‚Üí runs tests ‚Üí logs success
  2. Adds password hashing ‚Üí runs tests ‚Üí logs success
  3. Creates JWT utilities ‚Üí runs tests ‚Üí logs success
  4. ... continues through all steps

## Key Benefits Demonstrated

1. **No Hallucinations**: Agent follows exact guidance and instructions
2. **Structured Process**: Clear phases prevent skipping important steps
3. **Mandatory Execution**: Each guidance tool provides authoritative instructions that must be followed
4. **Error Recovery**: Built-in error handling prevents workflow breakdown
5. **State Tracking**: Complete audit trail of all actions taken
6. **Quality Assurance**: Tests run after every change ensure code quality
7. **User Control**: User approval required for major implementation plans

This example shows how the Development Workflow MCP server provides **mandatory execution guidance** that ensures agents follow a disciplined, methodical approach to development tasks.
