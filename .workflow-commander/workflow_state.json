  "plan": "## Implementation Plan\n\n### Step 1: Create YAML Workflow Models and Validation\n- **Action**: Create new Pydantic models for YAML workflow definitions\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/yaml_workflow.py` (create)\n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/yaml_loader.py` (create)\n- **Dependencies**: Add PyYAML to pyproject.toml\n- **Command**: `python -c \"from dev_workflow_mcp.models.yaml_workflow import WorkflowDefinition; print('‚úÖ Models created')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: YAML workflow models can parse the provided workflow.yaml structure\n\n### Step 2: Create Workflow Discovery Tool\n- **Action**: Implement workflow_discovery tool for finding and selecting workflows\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/discovery_prompts.py` (create)\n  - Update `src/dev_workflow_mcp/server.py` (register discovery prompts)\n- **Command**: `python -c \"import sys; sys.path.append('src'); from dev_workflow_mcp.prompts.discovery_prompts import register_discovery_prompts; print('‚úÖ Discovery tool created')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: workflow_discovery tool can scan .workflow-commander/workflows and select appropriate workflow\n\n### Step 3: Refactor Workflow State for Dynamic Workflows\n- **Action**: Make WorkflowState generic to support any workflow structure\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py` (modify)\n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/session_manager.py` (modify)\n- **Command**: `python -c \"from dev_workflow_mcp.models.workflow_state import DynamicWorkflowState; print('‚úÖ Dynamic state model created')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: State management works with any workflow definition, not just hardcoded phases\n\n### Step 4: Create Dynamic Workflow Engine\n- **Action**: Implement workflow execution engine that processes YAML-defined workflows\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/workflow_engine.py` (create)\n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/node_executor.py` (create)\n- **Command**: `python -c \"from dev_workflow_mcp.utils.workflow_engine import WorkflowEngine; print('‚úÖ Workflow engine created')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: Engine can execute any workflow definition and transition between nodes correctly\n\n### Step 5: Refactor Phase Prompts to Use Dynamic Engine\n- **Action**: Replace hardcoded workflow logic with dynamic workflow execution\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/phase_prompts.py` (major refactor)\n- **Command**: `python -c \"import sys; sys.path.append('src'); from dev_workflow_mcp.prompts.phase_prompts import workflow_guidance; print('‚úÖ Dynamic workflow guidance working')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: workflow_guidance tool works with any YAML-defined workflow\n\n### Step 6: Create Default Workflow Definitions\n- **Action**: Create default workflows that replicate current behavior\n- **Files**: \n  - `.workflow-commander/workflows/default-coding.yaml` (create)\n  - `.workflow-commander/workflows/documentation.yaml` (create)\n  - `.workflow-commander/workflows/debugging.yaml` (create)\n- **Command**: `ls -la .workflow-commander/workflows/`\n- **Success Criteria**: Default workflows available that maintain current functionality\n\n### Step 7: Create Workflow Templates System\n- **Action**: Add template system for creating new workflow definitions\n- **Files**: \n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/templates/workflow_template.yaml` (create)\n  - `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/template_generator.py` (create)\n- **Command**: `python -c \"from dev_workflow_mcp.utils.template_generator import create_workflow_template; print('‚úÖ Templates working')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: Users can generate new workflow templates easily\n\n### Step 8: Update Configuration and Documentation\n- **Action**: Update project configuration and add documentation for YAML workflows\n- **Files**: \n  - `pyproject.toml` (add PyYAML dependency)\n  - `README.md` (add YAML workflow documentation)\n  - `.workflow-commander/project_config.md` (update)\n- **Command**: `uv sync` and `python -c \"import yaml; print('‚úÖ PyYAML available')\"`\n- **Success Criteria**: Dependencies installed and documentation updated\n\n### Step 9: Update Tests and Validation\n- **Action**: Update test suite for new YAML workflow system\n- **Files**: \n  - `tests/test_yaml_workflows/` (create directory)\n  - `tests/test_yaml_workflows/test_workflow_discovery.py` (create)\n  - `tests/test_yaml_workflows/test_dynamic_engine.py` (create)\n  - Update existing tests to work with dynamic workflows\n- **Command**: `python -m pytest tests/ --tb=short -q`\n- **Success Criteria**: All tests pass with new dynamic workflow system\n\n**Testing Strategy:**\n- Unit tests for each new component\n- Integration tests for workflow execution\n- Backward compatibility tests with existing functionality\n- End-to-end tests with sample YAML workflows\n\n**Risk Mitigation:**\n- Gradual migration maintaining backward compatibility\n- Comprehensive test coverage before removing hardcoded workflows\n- Default workflows that replicate current behavior\n- Clear rollback procedures for each step\n\n**Quality Gates:**\n- All existing functionality preserved\n- New YAML workflows execute correctly\n- Performance doesn't degrade significantly\n- Full test suite passes\n\n**Version Management:**\n- Since this is a versioned MCP server, users will upgrade to the new version naturally\n- Backward compatibility ensures smooth transition without manual migration\n- Default workflows provide immediate functionality upon upgrade",

    "[10:38:32] Analysis Summary: Analysis Summary: Current Architecture: The MCP server has a hardcoded workflow with fixed phases (INIT, ANALYZE, BLUEPRINT, CONSTRUCT, VALIDATE) and uses consolidated smart tools (workflow_guidance and workflow_state) that handle different actions. The system includes robust session management, state tracking (both memory and optional file-based), and extensive validation.\n\nKey Components to Refactor:\n1. src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/phase_prompts.py - Contains hardcoded workflow logic in action handlers\n2. src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py - Has hardcoded phase enums and workflow template\n3. src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/session_manager.py - Manages workflow state with fixed phase assumptions\n4. src/dev_workflow_mcp/server.py - Registers fixed prompt modules\n\nYAML Structure Requirements (from workflow.yaml):\n- Workflows defined with inputs, execution config, goal, and decision tree\n- Nodes can be decision nodes (with children) or leaf nodes\n- Each node has goals, acceptance criteria, and next_allowed_nodes/workflows\n- Support for conditional execution and workflow chaining\n- Root node defines entry point\n\nRequired Features:\n1. workflow_discovery tool to find and select appropriate workflows from .workflow-commander/workflows\n2. Dynamic workflow loading and validation\n3. Flexible state management that adapts to any workflow structure\n4. Maintain existing logging, validation, and session management\n5. Support for multiple workflows and workflow selection based on task description\n\nCurrent State Management: Uses WorkflowPhase/WorkflowStatus enums, WorkflowState model with MARKDOWN_TEMPLATE, session-based tracking with JSON/MD export options.\n\nRisk Assessment: Complex refactoring requiring careful preservation of existing functionality while introducing dynamic behavior.",
