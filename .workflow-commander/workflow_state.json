This change must maintain all existing functionality while providing better structured data management for log entries.\n\n**Affected Components:**\n- Core Model: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py` (field types, methods)\n- Test Files: `tests/test_models/test_workflow_state.py` (all log-related tests)\n- Supporting tests in session_manager, integration, and conftest files\n\n**Current State:** Logs are strings concatenated with newlines and timestamps. Methods like `add_log_entry()` append with format `\"\\n[timestamp] entry\"`, and `rotate_log()` moves content with separators.\n\n**Dependencies:** Pydantic validation, backward compatibility for markdown parsing, session management integration, type checking with mypy.\n\n**Success Criteria:** All existing functionality preserved, tests pass, quality gates pass, data integrity maintained, backward compatibility preserved.\n\n**Risks:** String concatenation patterns, timestamp formatting, log rotation logic, markdown parsing complexity, JSON schema changes, extensive test dependencies.\n[15:45:01] Implementation plan completed and ready for user review. Plan includes 10 atomic steps covering model field type changes, method refactoring, markdown/JSON serialization updates, comprehensive test updates, and full quality validation with detailed rollback procedures.\n[15:46:06] ðŸ”¨ CONSTRUCT PHASE STARTED: Refactor: Change log and archive_log fields from strings to lists in WorkflowState model\n[15:57:55] âœ… VALIDATE PHASE STARTED: Refactor: Change log and archive_log fields from strings to lists in WorkflowState model",
