Primary File: src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/phase_prompts.py - Add new consolidated tools\n2. Tool Registration: Integration with existing register_phase_prompts(mcp) function  \n3. Session Management: Utilizes existing session state infrastructure\n4. Workflow State: Leverages existing WorkflowPhase/WorkflowStatus enums\n5. File Operations: Maintains compatibility with local state file feature\n\nCurrent State: 6 individual phase tools (init, analyze, blueprint, construct, validate, revise) each with specific parameters and substantial guidance content. Tools follow pattern: validate task_description â†’ update session state â†’ return detailed guidance. All tools integrate with session management and file operations with rich guidance content including mandatory checklists, examples, anti-patterns.\n\nDependencies & Constraints: Must maintain existing session_manager and state_manager utilities, preserve all rich guidance content, follow existing task_description validation, integrate with workflow state file operations, work alongside existing management/transition/project prompts, maintain backward compatibility.\n\nSuccess Criteria: 2 new smart tools provide equivalent functionality to current 6 tools with action-based approach (\"start\", \"plan\", \"build\", \"revise\", \"next\"), all existing guidance content preserved, state management integration works, tests pass, smooth migration path.\n\nRisk Assessment: Large amount of guidance content to consolidate without losing detail, complex parameter handling for context-sensitive actions, integration complexity with existing session state management, potential breaking changes during transition.",

Primary File: src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/phase_prompts.py - Remove 6 legacy tool functions (~900 lines of code)\n2. Test Files: tests/test_prompts/test_phase_prompts.py, tests/test_server.py, tests/integration/test_workflow_integration.py, tests/test_prompts/test_management_prompts.py - Update tests to remove legacy tool references\n3. Cross-References: Update any remaining references in management_prompts.py and other files\n\nCurrent State: The codebase currently has both legacy and consolidated tools coexisting. The legacy tools include init_workflow_guidance (~56 lines), analyze_phase_guidance (~137 lines), blueprint_phase_guidance (~262 lines), construct_phase_guidance (~176 lines), validate_phase_guidance (~230 lines), revise_blueprint_guidance (~71 lines).\n\nDependencies & Constraints: Must maintain the new consolidated tools (workflow_guidance, workflow_state) which provide equivalent functionality, must update all test expectations to reflect reduced tool count (from 8 to 2 tools), must preserve all session management and state management utilities, must ensure no breaking changes to the MCP server registration process, must maintain backward compatibility for any external references.\n\nSuccess Criteria: All 6 legacy tools completely removed from phase_prompts.py, all tests updated and passing with new tool count expectations, no references to legacy tools remain in codebase, consolidated tools continue to work correctly, MCP server starts and registers tools successfully, code quality gates (linting, formatting, type checking) pass.\n\nRisk Assessment: Low Risk - Well-defined removal task with clear boundaries, comprehensive test suite will catch any issues, Git history preserves legacy tools if needed, no external dependencies on specific tool names, existing tests provide safety net for functionality."
