## Task Execution Guidelines

### 🚨 MANDATORY WORKFLOW COMPLIANCE 🚨
**Before starting ANY task, evaluate it using these criteria:**

#### Use Workflow Tools When:
- Task involves multiple steps or phases
- Task requires coordination across multiple files
- Task involves creating, modifying, or analyzing code structures
- Task requires planning, analysis, or systematic approach
- Task involves debugging, testing, or validation
- Task creates new features, components, or systems
- **When in doubt, ALWAYS use workflows**

#### Only Skip Workflows For:
- Single mathematical calculations
- One-line explanations or definitions
- Direct copy/paste operations
- Immediate answers to factual questions

### 🔍 SESSION AWARENESS & WORKFLOW DISCOVERY
**⚠️ MANDATORY PRE-WORKFLOW CHECK:** Before starting ANY new workflow, check for existing sessions:**

#### STEP 0: CHECK EXISTING SESSIONS (REQUIRED FIRST STEP)
```
workflow_cache_management(operation="list")
```
**Purpose:** Check for existing workflow sessions to avoid conflicts and enable session resumption
**Results:** 
- **Active Session Found & Applicable:** Resume existing workflow using its session_id
- **Active Session Found & NOT Applicable:** Start new workflow for current task
- **No Active Sessions:** Proceed to workflow discovery
- **Multiple Sessions:** Choose appropriate session, complete irrelevant ones, or start new

#### Session Applicability Assessment:
Before resuming any existing session, verify:
- Is the existing workflow relevant to the current task?
- Are you continuing the same work or starting something different?
- **If the task is different or unrelated → START NEW WORKFLOW**

#### Session Resumption Pattern:
If existing session found AND applicable to current task, resume with:
```
workflow_guidance(session_id="found-session-id", action="next", context='{"choose": "current_node"}')
```

#### Session Conflict Resolution:
If multiple active sessions exist:
1. **Check session status** with `workflow_cache_management(operation="list")`
2. **Evaluate session relevance** to current task  
3. **CRITICAL:** Only resume if directly related to current task
4. **If unrelated:** Complete or abandon existing sessions and start new workflow

### 🔄 MANDATORY WORKFLOW ENTRY PROCESS
**⚠️ NON-NEGOTIABLE:** For ALL qualifying tasks, follow this exact sequence:

#### STEP 1: DISCOVER (REQUIRED AFTER SESSION CHECK)
```
workflow_discovery(task_description="[Exact user request]")
```
**Purpose:** View all available YAML workflows and their capabilities
**Result:** List of workflows with descriptions and suitability assessment

#### STEP 2: CHOOSE AND START (REQUIRED SECOND STEP)
```
workflow_guidance(action="start", context="workflow: [Selected Workflow Name]")
```
**Purpose:** Initialize the selected workflow session
**Result:** Workflow begins with first phase instructions

#### STEP 3: FOLLOW SCHEMA (ONGOING) 
```
workflow_guidance(action="next", context='{"choose": "[option]", "criteria_evidence": {"criterion": "detailed evidence"}}')
```
**Purpose:** Navigate through workflow phases using YAML-defined transitions with detailed evidence
**Result:** Structured progression through the complete workflow with work tracking

### 🎯 Decision Framework
**Use this exact decision tree for EVERY user request:**

1. **Is this a single, immediate action?** 
   - YES: Proceed directly (rare cases only)
   - NO: Go to Step 2

2. **Does the task involve ANY of these?**
   - Multiple files or components? → USE WORKFLOW
   - Planning or analysis phase? → USE WORKFLOW  
   - Code creation or modification? → USE WORKFLOW
   - Testing or validation? → USE WORKFLOW
   - Debugging or troubleshooting? → USE WORKFLOW
   - Documentation or explanation? → USE WORKFLOW

3. **Still uncertain?** → USE WORKFLOW (default choice)

### 🏗️ Dynamic Workflow System Architecture
The workflow system operates on these principles:

1. **Schema-Driven Navigation**: All workflow behavior defined by YAML schemas
2. **Agent-Driven Selection**: You choose workflows based on task requirements  
3. **Dynamic Discovery**: System discovers available workflows automatically
4. **Context Parameters**: Control execution with JSON format: `context='{"choose": "node_name", "criteria_evidence": {...}}'`
5. **No Hardcoded Routes**: All transitions defined in YAML `next_allowed_nodes`

### 📋 Available Workflow Tools
- `workflow_cache_management` - **CHECK FIRST ALWAYS** - List and manage cached sessions for conflict resolution  
- `workflow_discovery` - **START HERE FOR NEW WORKFLOWS** - Discover available YAML workflows
- `workflow_guidance` - Main execution engine for dynamic workflows
- `workflow_state` - Check specific session state (requires session_id)
- `workflow_creation_guidance` - Create custom workflows when existing ones don't fit

### 📚 Supporting Tools
- Context7: Real-time documentation lookup
- GitHub: Repository file access
- Standard coding tools: file operations, terminal, search, etc.

### 🆔 SESSION ID MANAGEMENT
**All workflows auto-generate unique session IDs for multi-session support:**

#### Session ID Usage Patterns:
```
# Check existing sessions first (MANDATORY)
workflow_cache_management(operation="list")

# If no active sessions, start new workflow
workflow_discovery(task_description="Your task")
workflow_guidance(action="start", context="workflow: Selected Workflow")

# Continue with session_id for targeted operations (returned in response)
workflow_guidance(session_id="abc-123", action="next", context='{"choose": "option"}')
workflow_state(session_id="abc-123", operation="get")
```

#### Multi-Session Benefits:
- **Parallel Workflows**: Run multiple workflows simultaneously
- **Session Continuity**: Resume specific workflows after interruption  
- **Session Isolation**: Keep different tasks completely separate
- **Session Tracking**: Monitor progress of individual workflows

#### Session Discovery Commands:
```
# List all cached sessions for current client (DISCOVERY PRIMARY METHOD)
workflow_cache_management(operation="list")

# Get specific session state
workflow_state(session_id="session-id", operation="get")

# Restore sessions from cache after restart
workflow_cache_management(operation="restore")
```

#### Best Practices:
- **ALWAYS check existing sessions BEFORE starting new workflows**
- **ALWAYS save session_id** from workflow start responses
- **ALWAYS include session_id** in subsequent workflow calls when available
- **Use session_id** when managing multiple concurrent workflows
- **Check session cache** after MCP server restarts for workflow continuity

### ⚡ Enforcement Rules
1. **NEVER skip session checking** before starting workflows
2. **ALWAYS start with `workflow_cache_management(operation="list")`** for session awareness
3. **ALWAYS use `workflow_discovery()`** for new workflows after session check
4. **NEVER use legacy approaches** when workflow tools are available
5. **ALWAYS follow YAML schema transitions** rather than making ad-hoc decisions
6. **WHEN UNCERTAIN → USE WORKFLOWS** (fail-safe principle)
7. **ALWAYS handle session conflicts** before proceeding with new workflows
