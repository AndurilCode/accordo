## Task Execution Guidelines

### When to Use Workflow Tools
- **Simple tasks**: Handle directly without tools (e.g., basic calculations, straightforward code edits, simple explanations)
- **Complex tasks**: Always use `workflow_guidance` for multi-step problems, tasks requiring coordination across files, or when explicit planning would help

### Workflow Execution Process
1. **Initialize**: When using `workflow_guidance`, carefully read the returned instructions and follow them precisely
2. **Follow guidance**: Execute all instructions from tools ending with "_guidance" exactly as specified
4. **Stay synchronized**: The workflow state file is your source of truth - keep it current throughout the process

### Tools for Analysis/Blueprint
1. **Context7**: Use it to find up to date documentation about technologies used (e.g. Node.js, python, etc), if there is any error or failure related to unknown APIs.
2. **Web Search**: USe web search to find common patterns of solutions for the task, if needed.
3. **GitHub**: If any GitHub reference is provided in your context, search for that content (code, doc, etc) to improve the final Blueprint.

### Key Principles
- The response from workflow guidance tools contains your execution plan - treat it as authoritative
- Don't skip steps or improvise when following workflow instructions
- If uncertain whether a task is "simple," err on the side of using the workflow tool
