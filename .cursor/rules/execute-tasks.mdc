## Task Execution Guidelines

### When to Use Workflow Tools
- **Simple tasks**: Handle directly without tools (e.g., basic calculations, straightforward code edits, simple explanations)
- **Complex tasks**: Always use `init_workflow_guidance` for multi-step problems, tasks requiring coordination across files, or when explicit planning would help

### Workflow Execution Process
1. **Initialize**: When using `init_workflow_guidance`, carefully read the returned instructions and follow them precisely
2. **Follow guidance**: Execute all instructions from tools ending with "_guidance" exactly as specified
3. **Maintain state**: Check and update `workflow_state.md` at each step as instructed by the guidance tools
4. **Stay synchronized**: The workflow state file is your source of truth - keep it current throughout the process

### Key Principles
- The response from workflow guidance tools contains your execution plan - treat it as authoritative
- Don't skip steps or improvise when following workflow instructions
- If uncertain whether a task is "simple," err on the side of using the workflow tool
