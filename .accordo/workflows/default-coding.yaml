    semantic_analysis:
      goal: "Analyze with historical context"
      instructions: |
        1. Perform baseline analysis
        2. Search for similar past work
        3. Learn from completed projects  
        4. Identify risks from historical failures
        5. Synthesize current + historical insights
        6. Create evidence-based recommendations
      
      acceptance_criteria:
        historical_context: "Found relevant past work with semantic search"
        lessons_integration: "Integrated lessons from completed similar workflows"
        risk_assessment: "Identified risks based on historical patterns"
        synthesis_report: "Combined current understanding with historical insights"

    # Analysis phase - understand requirements and codebase
    analyze:
      goal: |
        **ANALYZE PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}

        Thoroughly understand the task requirements, explore the codebase, and gather all necessary information before proceeding to planning. This is a discovery and understanding phase only - no code should be written or plans created.

        **Focus:** Comprehensive information gathering and requirements analysis.
      acceptance_criteria:
        project_config_analysis: "MUST read `${{ inputs.project_config_path }}` completely and understand coding standards, dependencies, test commands, and project structure constraints"
        codebase_exploration: "MUST use semantic search to find related code patterns, understand current architecture and design patterns, identify files that need modification, and examine similar implementations for consistency"
        requirements_analysis: "MUST decompose task into specific actionable requirements, identify scope boundaries and what's in/out of scope, note any ambiguities requiring clarification, and identify potential risks and complexity factors"
        documentation_review: "MUST summarize understanding of task requirements, list all affected components and files, identify integration points and dependencies, and note any constraints or special considerations"
        understanding_validation: "Can clearly explain task requirements and identify all affected components with comprehensive understanding documented"
      next_allowed_nodes: [blueprint]

    # Planning phase - create comprehensive implementation strategy
    blueprint:
      goal: |
        **BLUEPRINT PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}

        Create a comprehensive implementation plan with clear architecture, step-by-step execution strategy, and testing approach. The plan should be detailed enough for systematic execution.
      acceptance_criteria:
        solution_architecture: "MUST define overall technical approach and strategy, specify design patterns and architectural decisions, identify all files to create/modify with rationale, and plan for error handling and edge cases"
        step_breakdown: "MUST break implementation into atomic ordered steps, ensure each step is small specific and verifiable, include verification commands for each step, and specify success criteria and validation methods"
        quality_plan: "MUST plan how each component will be tested, identify integration points requiring validation, specify acceptance criteria and quality gates, and include regression testing considerations"
        implementation_plan: "MUST create detailed implementation plan under ## Plan section, include risk assessment and mitigation strategies, specify quality assurance checkpoints, and define rollback procedures if needed"
        plan_approval: "Plan is comprehensive, actionable, and ready for systematic execution with user approval obtained"
      needs_approval: true
      next_allowed_nodes: [construct]

    # Implementation phase - execute the plan systematically
    construct:
      goal: |
        **CONSTRUCT PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}

        Execute the approved implementation plan systematically, following each step in sequence with proper verification and progress tracking.

        **Key Points:** Complete each step fully before proceeding, maintain detailed progress logs, and ensure quality standards throughout.
      acceptance_criteria:
        step_execution: "MUST implement each planned step in exact sequence, complete each step fully before proceeding to next, NOT skip combine or reorder steps, and follow the approved implementation plan precisely"
        progress_logging: "MUST call workflow_state tool after EVERY major step with detailed and clear description of the step, log with format 'workflow_state(operation=\"update\", updates='{\"log_entry\": \"Step X: [description] - [status]\"}')', capture verification results in each log entry, and document any deviations from plan with rationale"
        verification_results: "MUST run verification commands immediately after each change, test functionality works as expected, run linting/formatting checks and fix any issues, and ensure code quality standards are maintained"
        quality_validation: "Code follows project standards with no new linting errors and quality gates passed"
        backwards_compatibility: "No breaking changes introduced unless explicitly specified in requirements"
        integration_check: "All imports resolve correctly with no circular dependencies and integration points tested"
      next_allowed_nodes: [complete]

    # Completion phase - finalize and document
    complete:
      goal: |
        **COMPLETE PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}

        Finalize the implementation by updating documentation, performing final validation, and providing a comprehensive summary of the work completed.

        **Outcome:** Task successfully completed with full validation and documentation.
      acceptance_criteria:
        changelog_update: "MUST update project changelog with summary of changes, document new features fixes or improvements, include version information if applicable, and ensure changelog follows project format"
        final_validation: "MUST verify all acceptance criteria met across all phases, confirm implementation is production-ready, ensure no outstanding issues or technical debt, and validate system stability and performance"
        workflow_summary: "MUST provide comprehensive summary of work performed, document outcomes and achievements, note any limitations or future considerations, and confirm successful completion of all objectives"
        completion_status: "MUST call workflow_state to mark workflow as completed, ensure all session data properly finalized, and confirm task requirements fully satisfied"
