EXAMINE RELEVANT CODE SECTIONS** \u26a0\ufe0f MANDATORY\n   - MUST analyze code areas related to bug symptoms\n   - MUST review recent changes that might have introduced the bug\n   - MUST examine logic flows and data handling in affected areas\n   - MUST identify potential code paths leading to the issue\n\n**2. TRACE EXECUTION PATHS** \u26a0\ufe0f MANDATORY\n   - MUST trace code execution from entry point to bug manifestation\n   - MUST identify decision points and branching logic\n   - MUST understand data flow and transformations\n   - MUST map execution path that leads to the problematic behavior\n\n**3. IDENTIFY ROOT CAUSE** \u26a0\ufe0f MANDATORY\n   - MUST pinpoint the exact source of the bug\n   - MUST differentiate between root cause and symptoms\n   - MUST understand why the bug occurs under specific conditions\n   - MUST verify root cause explains all observed symptoms\n\n**4. ANALYZE CONTRIBUTING FACTORS** \u26a0\ufe0f MANDATORY\n   - MUST identify any environmental or configuration factors\n   - MUST understand dependencies that contribute to the issue\n   - MUST identify any timing or race condition factors\n   - MUST document all conditions necessary for bug to occur\n\n**ANALYSIS DEPTH:** Root cause analysis must be thorough and definitive.\n",
