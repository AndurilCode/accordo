        REQUIRED ACTIONS:
        1. Create workflow_state.md with this exact structure:

        ```markdown
        # workflow_state.md
        _Last updated: {{current_date}}_

        ## State
        Phase: INIT  
        Status: READY  
        CurrentItem: {task_description}  

        ## Plan
        <!-- The AI fills this in during the BLUEPRINT phase -->

        ## Rules
        > **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

        ### [PHASE: ANALYZE]
        1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.  
        2. Summarize requirements. *No code or planning.*

        ### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]
        1. Decompose task into ordered steps.  
        2. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.  
        3. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

        ### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]
        1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.  
        2. After each atomic change:  
        - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`  
        - capture tool output in **## Log**  
        3. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

        ### [PHASE: VALIDATE]
        1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.  
        2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.  
        3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.

        ---

        ### RULE_INIT_01
        Trigger ▶ `Phase == INIT`  
        Action ▶ Ask user for first high-level task → `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = RUNNING`.

        ### RULE_ITERATE_01
        Trigger ▶ `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`  
        Action ▶  
        1. Set `CurrentItem` to next unprocessed row in **## Items**.  
        2. Clear **## Log**, reset `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = READY`.

        ### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01
        Trigger ▶ `length(## Log) > 5 000 chars`  
        Action ▶ Summarise the top 5 findings from **## Log** into **## ArchiveLog**, then clear **## Log**.

        ### RULE_SUMMARY_01
        Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
        Action ▶ 
        1. Read `project_config.md`.
        2. Construct the new changelog line: `- <One-sentence summary of completed work>`.
        3. Find the `## Changelog` heading in `project_config.md`.
        4. Insert the new changelog line immediately after the `## Changelog` heading and its following newline (making it the new first item in the list).
