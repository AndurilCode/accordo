description: Template for creating custom workflows - replace this description with your workflow's purpose

inputs:
  task_description:
    type: string
    description: Task provided by the user
    required: true
  # Add more inputs as needed
  # custom_parameter:
  #   type: string
  #   description: Description of your custom parameter
  #   required: false
  #   default: "default_value"

workflow:
  goal: Define the overall goal of your workflow here

  # Specify the starting node of your workflow
  root: start_node

  tree:
    # Define your workflow nodes here
    # Each node should have a goal, acceptance_criteria, and next_allowed_nodes
    
    start_node:
      goal: |
        Define what this node should accomplish.
        Use ${{ inputs.task_description }} to reference workflow inputs.
        Be specific about what actions should be taken.
      acceptance_criteria:
        # Define criteria that must be met to complete this node
        first_criterion: "Description of what constitutes completion for this criterion"
        second_criterion: "Another completion criterion"
        # Add more criteria as needed
      next_allowed_nodes: [second_node, alternative_node]  # List nodes that can follow this one

    second_node:
      goal: |
        Define the goal for the second step in your workflow.
        Each node should have a clear, actionable goal.
      acceptance_criteria:
        completion_check: "What needs to be done to consider this node complete"
        quality_gate: "Quality standards that must be met"
      next_allowed_nodes: [final_node]

    alternative_node:
      goal: |
        This represents an alternative path in your workflow.
        Useful for handling different scenarios or conditions.
      acceptance_criteria:
        alternative_completion: "Criteria specific to this alternative path"
      next_allowed_nodes: [final_node]

    final_node:
      goal: |
        The final step in your workflow.
        Should complete the overall objective.
      acceptance_criteria:
        task_completed: "All workflow objectives achieved"
        deliverables_ready: "Final deliverables prepared and validated"
      next_allowed_nodes: []  # Empty list indicates this is a terminal node

# Template Usage Instructions:
# 1. Replace the template name and description with your workflow specifics
# 2. Define any additional inputs your workflow needs
# 3. Update the workflow goal to match your objectives
# 4. Customize each node's goal and acceptance criteria
# 5. Adjust the workflow tree structure to match your process
# 6. Test your workflow by loading it into the system

# Node Design Guidelines:
# - Each node should have a single, clear responsibility
# - Goals should be specific and actionable
# - Acceptance criteria should be measurable
# - Use decision nodes (with multiple next_allowed_nodes) for branching
# - Use terminal nodes (no next_allowed_nodes) for workflow endings
# - Reference inputs using ${{ inputs.parameter_name }} syntax
