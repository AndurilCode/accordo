# Workflow Commander Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for Workflow Commander MCP Server - a powerful system for dynamic YAML-driven workflow guidance for AI coding agents.

## 🚀 Key Feature: Dynamic Workflow Creation

**Breakthrough Capability:** Agents can generate custom YAML workflows on-the-fly for any task!

Unlike traditional workflow systems, Workflow Commander enables AI agents to:
- **Analyze task requirements** and create tailored workflows
- **Generate complete YAML workflows** with proper structure and logic
- **Execute custom workflows** with full state management and progression control
- **Adapt to any domain** - from web development to data science to DevOps

This makes the system infinitely extensible without requiring pre-built workflows for every possible task.
