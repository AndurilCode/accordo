# Semantic Analysis in Workflow Phases

## Overview

The workflow-commander cache system with semantic search enables agents to enhance analysis phases by leveraging historical context from similar past work. This guide shows practical examples of how agents can use semantic search to create richer, more informed analysis.

## How It Works

### 1. Automatic Knowledge Accumulation
- Every workflow execution is automatically stored with embeddings
- Task descriptions, implementation details, and outcomes become searchable
- Agents build an organizational knowledge base over time

### 2. Semantic Search During Analysis
- Agents query past work using natural language descriptions
- Vector embeddings find semantically similar tasks and contexts
- Results include similarity scores, metadata, and historical patterns

### 3. Enhanced Decision Making
- Historical context informs current analysis
- Proven patterns reduce risk and accelerate development
- Past failures provide risk mitigation insights

## Practical Usage Examples

### Example 1: Database Performance Analysis

**Scenario**: Agent needs to optimize slow database queries

**Traditional Analysis**:
```
Current task: Optimize slow database queries
- Analyze current query performance
- Identify bottlenecks
- Plan optimization approach
```

**Enhanced Analysis with Semantic Search**:
```
1. Baseline Analysis:
   Current task: Optimize slow database queries affecting user experience
   
2. Historical Context Discovery:
   workflow_semantic_analysis(
     query="database performance optimization slow queries",
     analysis_type="similar_tasks",
     max_results=5
   )
   
   Results:
   - Project Alpha: 87% similarity - "PostgreSQL query optimization for user dashboard"
   - Project Beta: 76% similarity - "MySQL performance tuning slow reporting queries"  
   - Project Gamma: 65% similarity - "Database indexing strategy for large datasets"
   
3. Lessons Learned Analysis:
   workflow_semantic_analysis(
     query="database optimization performance",
     analysis_type="lessons_learned",
     max_results=3
   )
   
   Results:
   - Completed: "Adding composite indexes improved query time by 85%"
   - Completed: "Connection pooling reduced timeout issues significantly"
   - Completed: "Query caching at application level provided 60% performance boost"
   
4. Enhanced Analysis Output:
   Based on historical analysis:
   - Follow proven indexing strategy from Project Alpha (87% similar)
   - Implement connection pooling based on successful pattern from Project Beta
   - Consider query caching approach that showed 60% improvement
   - Avoid ORM optimization approach that failed in 2 similar projects
   - Plan for 2-week timeline based on historical data from similar complexity
```

### Example 2: React Component Development

**Scenario**: Agent building a new user dashboard component

   - Implement Chart.js integration following successful 76% similar approach
   - Add memory leak prevention based on lessons from 3 related failures
   - Plan for mobile-first responsive design using patterns from admin panel project
```

### Example 3: API Security Implementation

**Scenario**: Implementing authentication for a new API

**Semantic-Enhanced Analysis**:
```
1. Security Context Discovery:
   workflow_semantic_analysis(
     query="API authentication JWT OAuth2 security implementation",
     analysis_type="similar_tasks"
   )
   
   Security Patterns Found:
   - 91% similar: "JWT authentication with refresh token implementation"
   - 84% similar: "OAuth2 integration with Google and GitHub providers"

2. Security Lessons Analysis:
   workflow_semantic_analysis(
     query="JWT token security vulnerability",
     analysis_type="lessons_learned"
   )
   
   Critical Security Lessons:
   - JWT secret rotation strategy prevented security breach
   - Token expiry handling crucial for user experience
   - CORS configuration errors caused production issues in 2 projects
   - Rate limiting prevented DOS attacks in 3 similar APIs
   
3. Cross-Domain Security Insights:
   workflow_semantic_analysis(
     query="authentication security best practices",
     analysis_type="related_context"
   )
   
   Broader Security Context:
   - Password hashing strategies from user management systems
   - Session management patterns from web applications
   - Multi-factor authentication approaches from enterprise systems
   - Audit logging patterns from financial applications
   
4. Risk-Informed Implementation:

## Tool Integration in Workflows

### Core Semantic Analysis Tool

```yaml
workflow_semantic_analysis(
  query="description of current task or context",
  analysis_type="similar_tasks|related_context|lessons_learned",
  max_results=5,
  min_similarity=0.3
)
```

**Parameters**:
- `query`: Natural language description of current task/problem
- `analysis_type`: Type of analysis needed
  - `similar_tasks`: Find similar past work and approaches
  - `related_context`: Find related domains and technologies  
  - `lessons_learned`: Find completed similar workflows with outcomes
- `max_results`: Number of results to return (1-20)
- `min_similarity`: Similarity threshold (0.0-1.0)

### Workflow Integration Pattern

```yaml
# Analysis phase with semantic enhancement
analysis_phase:
  goal: "Analyze requirements with historical context"
  instructions: |
    1. Perform baseline analysis of current requirements
    2. Use workflow_semantic_analysis() to find relevant past work
    3. Integrate historical insights into analysis
    4. Document synthesis of current + historical understanding
  
  acceptance_criteria:
    baseline_analysis: "Current requirements fully understood"
    historical_context: "Relevant past work discovered and analyzed"
    integrated_insights: "Historical lessons integrated into current analysis"
```
