    # Initial analysis phase - no approval needed
    analyze:
      goal: |
        **ANALYZE PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        Thoroughly analyze the task requirements and gather necessary information.
        This phase does not require approval and can proceed automatically.
        
        **Focus:** Understanding and information gathering.
      acceptance_criteria:
        requirements_clear: "Task requirements are clearly understood and documented"
        scope_defined: "Project scope and boundaries are clearly defined"
        resources_identified: "Required resources and dependencies identified"
      next_allowed_nodes: [plan_with_approval]

    # Planning phase - REQUIRES APPROVAL
    plan_with_approval:
      goal: |
        **PLANNING PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        ðŸš¨ **CRITICAL DECISION POINT** ðŸš¨
        
        Create a detailed implementation plan for the analyzed requirements.
        This phase requires explicit user approval before proceeding to implementation
        because the plan will determine the entire execution strategy.
        
        **Approval Required:** This node requires user approval before proceeding.
        
        **Focus:** Strategic planning and approach definition.
      acceptance_criteria:
        plan_created: "Detailed implementation plan created with clear steps"
        approach_selected: "Technical approach and methodology selected"
        timeline_estimated: "Timeline and milestones estimated"
        risks_assessed: "Potential risks identified and mitigation strategies planned"
      needs_approval: true
      next_allowed_nodes: [implement]

    # Implementation phase - no approval needed once plan is approved
    implement:
      goal: |
        **IMPLEMENTATION PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        Execute the approved plan systematically. Since the plan has been approved,
        this implementation phase can proceed without additional approval.
        
        **Focus:** Following the approved plan and implementing the solution.
      acceptance_criteria:
        code_implemented: "Core functionality implemented according to plan"
        tests_written: "Appropriate tests written and passing"
        documentation_updated: "Documentation updated to reflect changes"
      next_allowed_nodes: [review_for_deployment]

    # Review phase - REQUIRES APPROVAL for deployment
    review_for_deployment:
      goal: |
        **DEPLOYMENT REVIEW:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        ðŸš¨ **FINAL APPROVAL CHECKPOINT** ðŸš¨
        
        Review the completed implementation for deployment readiness.
        This requires approval because deployment affects production systems.
        
        **Approval Required:** Explicit approval needed before deployment.
        
        **Focus:** Quality assurance and deployment readiness validation.
      acceptance_criteria:
        quality_verified: "Code quality meets deployment standards"
        security_checked: "Security review completed successfully"
        deployment_ready: "All deployment prerequisites satisfied"
        rollback_plan: "Rollback plan prepared in case of issues"
      needs_approval: true
      next_allowed_nodes: [deploy]

    # Deployment phase - no approval needed once review is approved
    deploy:
      goal: |
        **DEPLOYMENT PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        Execute the approved deployment plan. This phase proceeds automatically
        after receiving approval in the review phase.
        
        **Focus:** Safe deployment execution following approved procedures.
      acceptance_criteria:
        deployed_successfully: "Solution deployed to target environment"
        smoke_tests_passed: "Basic smoke tests confirm deployment success"
        monitoring_enabled: "Monitoring and alerting configured"
      next_allowed_nodes: [complete]

    # Final phase - terminal node (approval field ignored)
    complete:
      goal: |
        **COMPLETION PHASE:** ${{ inputs.task_description }}
        
        Finalize the workflow with summary and cleanup. This is a terminal node,
        so any needs_approval setting would be ignored.
        
        **Focus:** Project completion and handover.
      acceptance_criteria:
        project_completed: "All deliverables completed and verified"
        documentation_finalized: "Final documentation delivered"
        stakeholders_notified: "Relevant stakeholders notified of completion"
      needs_approval: true  # This will be ignored since it's a terminal node
      next_allowed_nodes: []  # Terminal node - workflow ends here

# Usage Examples:
#
# 1. Normal flow with approvals:
#    - Start: workflow_guidance(action="start", context="workflow: Approval Example Workflow")
#    - Progress through analyze phase normally
#    - At plan_with_approval: MUST provide user_approval: true to proceed
#    - Continue through implement phase normally  
#    - At review_for_deployment: MUST provide user_approval: true to proceed
#    - Complete deploy and finish phases
#
# 2. Example approval context:
#    workflow_guidance(action="next", context='{"choose": "implement", "user_approval": true, "criteria_evidence": {"plan_created": "Created detailed 5-step implementation plan", "approach_selected": "Using incremental deployment strategy"}}')
#
# 3. What happens without approval:
#    workflow_guidance(action="next", context='{"choose": "implement", "criteria_evidence": {"plan_created": "Plan ready"}}')
#    This will FAIL with an error message requiring explicit user approval.
