## Rules
> **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

### [PHASE: ANALYZE]
1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.  
2. Summarize requirements. *No code or planning.*

### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]
1. Decompose task into ordered steps.  
2. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.  
3. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]
1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.  
2. After each atomic change:  
   - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`  
   - capture tool output in **## Log**  
3. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

### [PHASE: VALIDATE]
1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.  
2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.  
3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.

---

### RULE_INIT_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == INIT`  
Action ▶ Ask user for first high-level task → `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = RUNNING`.

### RULE_ITERATE_01
Trigger ▶ `Status == COMPLETED && Items contains unprocessed rows`  
Action ▶  
1. Set `CurrentItem` to next unprocessed row in **## Items**.  
2. Clear **## Log**, reset `Phase = ANALYZE, Status = READY`.

### RULE_LOG_ROTATE_01
Trigger ▶ `length(## Log) > 5 000 chars`  
Action ▶ Summarise the top 5 findings from **## Log** into **## ArchiveLog**, then clear **## Log**.

### RULE_SUMMARY_01
Trigger ▶ `Phase == VALIDATE && Status == COMPLETED`  
Action ▶ 
1. Read `project_config.md`.
2. Construct the new changelog line: `- <One-sentence summary of completed work>`.
3. Find the `## Changelog` heading in `project_config.md`.
4. Insert the new changelog line immediately after the `## Changelog` heading and its following newline (making it the new first item in the list).

## Log
**COMPREHENSIVE PROJECT ANALYSIS COMPLETED**

**Project Overview:**
- MCP workflow framework with 143 tests achieving 99% code coverage
- Well-structured codebase with clear separation of concerns
- Comprehensive prompt-based workflow guidance system
- Strong test coverage and code quality (all linting checks pass)

**Current Strengths:**
1. **Architecture**: Clean modular design with separate concerns (models, prompts, utils, templates)
2. **Test Coverage**: Excellent 99% coverage with 143 comprehensive tests
3. **Code Quality**: All ruff linting checks pass, consistent formatting
4. **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and usage examples
5. **Workflow Design**: Well-designed phase-based workflow (ANALYZE → BLUEPRINT → CONSTRUCT → VALIDATE)
6. **State Management**: Robust state tracking with workflow_state.md
7. **Error Handling**: Built-in error recovery and validation guidance
8. **Tool Naming**: Recently improved from `_prompt` to `_guidance` suffix for clarity

**Areas for Robustness Improvements:**

**1. Error Handling & Resilience**
- Missing timeout handling for long-running operations
- No retry mechanisms for transient failures
- Limited validation of external dependencies
- No graceful degradation for partial failures
- Missing circuit breaker patterns for external calls

**2. Configuration & Environment Management**
- Hard-coded file paths (workflow_state.md, project_config.md)
- No environment-specific configuration support
- Missing configuration validation at startup
- No support for custom template locations
- Limited configurability of workflow behavior

**3. Logging & Observability**
- Basic logging in workflow_state.md only
- No structured logging with levels (DEBUG, INFO, WARN, ERROR)
- Missing metrics collection for workflow performance
- No distributed tracing for complex workflows
- Limited audit trail for workflow decisions

**4. Security & Validation**
- No input sanitization for user-provided content
- Missing file permission checks
- No validation of file sizes (potential DoS)
- Limited protection against path traversal attacks
- No rate limiting for tool calls

**5. Performance & Scalability**
- No caching mechanisms for repeated operations
- Synchronous file I/O operations
- No batch processing capabilities
- Missing optimization for large workflow states
- No memory usage monitoring

**6. Extensibility & Plugin Architecture**
- Hard-coded prompt registration
- No plugin system for custom workflow phases
- Limited customization of workflow rules
- No hooks for external integrations
- Missing event system for workflow notifications

**7. Data Persistence & Backup**
- Single file storage (workflow_state.md) - no backup strategy
- No versioning of workflow state changes
- Missing data corruption recovery
- No support for distributed storage
- Limited concurrent access handling

**8. Testing & Quality Assurance**
- Missing integration tests with real MCP clients
- No performance/load testing
- Limited edge case testing for file operations
- No chaos engineering tests
- Missing security vulnerability scanning

**9. Documentation & Developer Experience**
- Missing API documentation (OpenAPI/Swagger)

- Limited examples for complex workflows
- Missing migration guides for updates
- No developer onboarding documentation

**10. Monitoring & Alerting**
- No health check endpoints
- Missing workflow failure notifications
- No performance monitoring dashboards
- Limited diagnostic information
- No automated issue detection

**Priority Recommendations:**
1. **High**: Implement structured logging and error handling improvements
2. **High**: Add configuration management and environment support
3. **Medium**: Enhance security validation and input sanitization
4. **Medium**: Add performance monitoring and caching
5. **Low**: Implement plugin architecture and extensibility features

**Technical Debt:**
- Some missing coverage in state_manager.py (lines 35, 67) and validators.py (line 64)
- Pytest deprecation warning for asyncio_default_fixture_loop_scope
- Hard-coded paths and configuration values throughout codebase

**Overall Assessment:**
The project is well-architected with excellent test coverage and code quality. The main opportunities for robustness improvements lie in error handling, configuration management, observability, and security hardening. The codebase provides a solid foundation for implementing these enhancements.
