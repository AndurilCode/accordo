### CLIENT-SESSION BASED WORKFLOW STATE REFACTORING PLAN

**Overview**: Modernize workflow state management from file-based to client-session based using FastMCP Context and in-memory global dictionary while maintaining exact compatibility.

#### **Step 1: Enhance WorkflowState Model (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py`
- Add `client_id: str` field to WorkflowState class
- Add `created_at: datetime` field for session tracking  
- Add `to_markdown() -> str` method for markdown generation
- Add `from_markdown(content: str, client_id: str) -> WorkflowState` class method
- Maintain all existing fields and methods
- Add validation for client_id format

#### **Step 2: Create Session Manager (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/session_manager.py` (NEW)
- Global dictionary: `client_sessions: dict[str, WorkflowState] = {}`
- Thread lock for concurrent access: `session_lock = threading.Lock()`
- `get_session(client_id: str) -> WorkflowState | None`
- `create_session(client_id: str, task_description: str) -> WorkflowState`
- `update_session(client_id: str, **kwargs) -> bool`
- `delete_session(client_id: str) -> bool`
- `get_all_sessions() -> dict[str, WorkflowState]`
- `export_session_to_markdown(client_id: str) -> str | None`
- Error handling for missing sessions and concurrent access

#### **Step 3: Create Markdown Generator (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/markdown_generator.py` (NEW)
- `generate_workflow_markdown(state: WorkflowState) -> str`
- Use existing template format from `src/dev_workflow_mcp/templates/workflow_state_template.md`
- Support all current sections: State, Plan, Rules, Items, Log, ArchiveLog
- Format items table correctly
- Handle empty/null fields gracefully
- Add timestamp formatting

#### **Step 4: Update All Guidance Tools (HIGH PRIORITY)**
**Files**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/*.py`
- Add FastMCP Context parameter to all tool functions: `ctx: Context`
- Extract client_id from context: `client_id = ctx.client_id or "default"`
- Replace file operations with session operations
- Update state using session_manager instead of file operations
- Maintain exact same return values and guidance text
- Add fallback for missing client_id

**Specific tool updates:**
- `update_workflow_state_guidance()` - Update session state
- `create_workflow_state_file_guidance()` - Create new session
- All phase guidance tools - Use session state
- Management tools - Use session operations

#### **Step 5: Replace StateManager (MEDIUM PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/state_manager.py`
- Deprecate file-based operations
- Add session-based wrapper methods for backward compatibility
- Keep existing interface but delegate to session_manager
- Add migration helper to convert existing files to sessions
- Maintain error handling patterns

#### **Step 6: Update Server Initialization (LOW PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/server.py`
- Import session_manager and initialize global store
- Add cleanup handlers for server shutdown
- Add health check tool for session management
- Optional: Add session export/import tools for backup

#### **Step 7: Add New Utility Functions (LOW PRIORITY)**
**File**: `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/__init__.py`
- Export new session_manager and markdown_generator
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing exports

#### **Step 8: Update Tests (CRITICAL)**
**Files**: `tests/test_utils/`, `tests/test_prompts/`
- Create comprehensive tests for session_manager
- Add tests for markdown_generator
- Update existing tests to mock session operations
- Add concurrent access tests
- Test client_id handling and fallbacks
- Ensure 100% compatibility with existing behavior

**Implementation Order:**
1. Step 1: WorkflowState model enhancement
2. Step 2: Session manager creation  
3. Step 3: Markdown generator
4. Step 8: Test updates (parallel with implementation)
5. Step 4: Guidance tools updates
6. Step 5: StateManager deprecation
7. Step 6: Server initialization
8. Step 7: Utility exports

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement gradual rollout with feature flag
- Maintain backward compatibility throughout
- Add comprehensive error handling
- Test concurrent access thoroughly  
- Preserve exact workflow behavior
- Add session backup/recovery mechanisms

**Testing Strategy:**
- Unit tests for all new components
- Integration tests with multiple concurrent sessions
- Backward compatibility tests
- Performance tests vs file-based system
- Error handling and edge case tests

**Success Criteria:**
- All existing 143 tests continue to pass
- Support multiple concurrent clients
- Eliminate file I/O operations
- Maintain exact workflow behavior
- Thread-safe session operations
- Complete markdown format compatibility

**Rollback Plan:**
- Keep original file-based system as fallback
- Configuration toggle between systems
- Session export to files for emergency recovery
- Gradual migration path for existing users

This plan maintains the excellent existing architecture while modernizing the persistence layer for better scalability and concurrent access.

## Rules
> **Keep every major section under an explicit H2 (`##`) heading so the agent can locate them unambiguously.**

### [PHASE: ANALYZE]
1. Read **project_config.md**, relevant code & docs.  
2. Summarize requirements. *No code or planning.*

### [PHASE: BLUEPRINT]
1. Decompose task into ordered steps.  
2. Write pseudocode or file-level diff outline under **## Plan**.  
3. Set `Status = NEEDS_PLAN_APPROVAL` and await user confirmation.

### [PHASE: CONSTRUCT]
1. Follow the approved **## Plan** exactly.  
2. After each atomic change:  
   - run test / linter commands specified in `project_config.md`  
   - capture tool output in **## Log**  
3. On success of all steps, set `Phase = VALIDATE`.

### [PHASE: VALIDATE]
1. Rerun full test suite & any E2E checks.  
2. If clean, set `Status = COMPLETED`.  
3. Trigger **RULE_ITERATE_01** when applicable.

**COMPREHENSIVE REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS COMPLETED**

**Current State Assessment:**
1. **WorkflowState Model Exists But Unused**: The Pydantic model in `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py` defines excellent data structures but isn't actively used
2. **File-Based State Management**: Current system uses `workflow_state.md` file managed by `StateManager` class in `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/state_manager.py`
3. **Single-Client Design**: Current architecture assumes one workflow session per server instance
4. **No FastMCP Context Integration**: The codebase doesn't currently use FastMCP Context features like `client_id`

**Key Requirements Identified:**

**1. Client-Session Architecture**
- Add `client_id` field to `WorkflowState` model using FastMCP Context (`ctx.client_id`)
- Create global in-memory dictionary: `client_sessions: dict[str, WorkflowState]`
- Enable concurrent access from multiple clients
- Thread-safe operations for concurrent access

**2. State Persistence Strategy**
- Replace file-based `StateManager` with memory-based session manager
- Maintain WorkflowState objects in memory keyed by client ID
- Add state serialization/deserialization for markdown generation
- Implement backup/recovery for critical state data

**3. Integration with Existing Tools**
- Modify all guidance tools to use FastMCP Context for client identification
- Update state management tools to persist in global dict while returning guidance
- Maintain backward compatibility with existing workflow logic
- Preserve all current workflow rules and phase transitions

**4. Markdown Generation Function**
- Create function to convert `WorkflowState` object to markdown format
- Eliminate need for physical `workflow_state.md` file
- Support on-demand state visualization and debugging
- Maintain exact format compatibility with current template

**5. API Changes Required**
- Update all tools in `src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/` to inject FastMCP Context
- Modify `StateManager` to work with in-memory sessions instead of files
- Add session management utilities (create, get, update, delete sessions)
- Add thread synchronization for concurrent access

**Technical Implementation Details:**

**Files to Modify:**
1. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/models/workflow_state.py` - Add client_id field
2. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/state_manager.py` - Replace with session manager
3. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/prompts/*.py` - Add Context injection to all tools
4. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/server.py` - Initialize global session store

**Files to Create:**
1. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/session_manager.py` - New session management
2. `src/dev_workflow_mcp/utils/markdown_generator.py` - State to markdown conversion

**Benefits:**
- Support multiple concurrent clients
- Eliminate file I/O bottlenecks
- Better scalability and performance
- Cleaner architecture using existing Pydantic models
- Thread-safe concurrent access
- No more file permission or disk space issues

**Compatibility Considerations:**
- Maintain exact same workflow behavior for users
- Preserve all existing test coverage
- Keep markdown format identical to current template
- Maintain all workflow rules and phase transitions
- No breaking changes to tool interfaces

**Risk Mitigation:**
- Implement graceful fallback if client_id unavailable
- Add comprehensive error handling for session operations
- Maintain option to export sessions to files for backup
- Ensure thread-safety for all session operations

This refactoring will modernize the architecture while preserving all existing functionality and maintaining the excellent workflow design.
